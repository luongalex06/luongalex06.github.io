        <h1>About_Me.EXE</h1>
        <p>Growing up for me wasn't fun like other kids. I am a first generation american with mirgrant parents, so it was hard to communicate to my parents or making new friends, as I had a hard time speaking without stuttering. As life went on, I was disciplined more than I had fun because I was a reckless kid. Then, I became a high schooler, and my parents seem to think of my in a different way. I had more freedom and had more of a say in different topics and learned to acknowledge my parents more, as they understood me more!</p>
